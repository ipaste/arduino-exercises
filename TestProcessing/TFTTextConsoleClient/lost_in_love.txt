LOST IN LOVE

Oh I realize the best part of love

Is the thinnest slice

That it don't come for much

But I'm not letting go

I believe there's still much to believe in

So lift your eyes if you feel you can

Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan

I've figured it out

What I needed was someone to show me
